# Alignment and Projection of scRNA-seq and Spatial Transcriptomics in Whole Transcriptome Space
FAT is proposed as a conformable alignment and projection high throughput transcript gene expression prediction method. It deciphers both shared and whole space single-cell spatial data alignment and projection across species, paired/unpaired datasets, and sample conditions. 

# Installation
The requirements of FAT can be installed by:  
`conda env create -f requirements.yml`.
